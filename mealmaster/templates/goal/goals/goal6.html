        <h6>What is Mediterranean Diet</h6>
        <br>
        <p>The Mediterranean Diet is not a fad diet but rather a balanced eating plan inspired by the food habits of people
            living
            around the Mediterranean Sea, including Spain, Italy, France, Greece, and Turkey. This diet emphasizes a high
            intake of fruits and
            vegetables, along with healthy fats and carbohydrates, primarily through olive oil and spices. It is known for
            aiding weight loss and
            promoting overall health, reducing the risk of serious diseases like heart attacks and strokes.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h6> How to Start the Mediterranean Diet</h6>
        <br>
        <p>1. Focus on Fruits and Vegetables: Over half of your plate should consist of fresh fruits and vegetables.
            Salads drizzled with olive oil are common.</p>
        <br>
        <p>2. Emphasize Seafood: Fish is a key protein source,
            rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which helps with fat metabolism and reduces heart disease risk.</p>
        <br>
        <p>3. Regular Exercise: Incorporate physical activity into your routine.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h6>Dietary Proportions</h6>
        <br>
        <p>The Mediterranean diet is structured like a pyramid:</p>
        <br>
        <p>- Carbohydrates (50%): Prioritize whole grains and unrefined carbs from fruits and vegetables.</p>
        <p>- Protein (15%): Focus on seafood, poultry, and eggs, limiting red meat to weekly servings.</p>
        <p>- Healthy Fats (35%): Use olive oil and nuts daily in moderation.</p>
        <p>- Dairy: Consume cheese, milk, and yogurt sparingly.</p>
        <p>- Occasional Treats: Enjoy red meat and sweets occasionally.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h6>Recommended Foods and Drinks</h6>
        <br>

        </p>
        <p>2. Fruits: Apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, avocados, and pears.</p>

        <p>5. Seafood: Tuna, salmon, shrimp, squid, and crab.</p>
        <p>6. Healthy Fats: Extra virgin olive oil and avocado oil.</p>
        <p>7. Other Foods: Fresh milk, yogurt, potatoes, and chicken, along with herbs like garlic and rosemary.</p>
        <p>8. Water: Aim for at least 8 glasses daily, drinking some before meals.</p>
